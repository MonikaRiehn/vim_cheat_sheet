# The most important at first: How to exit vim ?

In whichever mode you are, press `ESC` to enter the command mode. Then type `:q`. If you made changes in a file before, you will have to save the changes by typing `:wq`. If you do not want the changes to be saved, type `:q!` to exit. Congratulations, you mastered one of the most difficult tasks in the world ;-)

# Why vim?

Opening csv files in a spreadsheet program is problematic, because these applications may introduce styles or hidden characters into the files and harming your data, which needs precision, not style. A text editor like vim (or VSC) handles your data like plain text and won't make any unwanted changes (Anthony DeBarros, Practical SQL, 2nd edition, 2022).
